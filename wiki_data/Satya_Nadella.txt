Early life
Nadella was born in Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh state, India[7] into a Telugu-speaking Hindu family.[8][9][10] His mother Prabhavati was a Sanskrit lecturer[11] and his father, Bukkapuram Nadella Yugandhar, was an Indian Administrative Service officer of the 1962 batch.[12][13][14] Yugandhar hailed from Bukkapuram in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh.[8][15] Yugandhar's father migrated from Nadella village in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh to Bukkapuram.[16][17]

Satya Nadella attended the Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet[18] before receiving a bachelor's in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology in Karnataka in 1988.[19][20] Nadella then traveled to the U.S. to study for an MS in computer science at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee,[21] receiving his degree in 1990.[22] Later, he received an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1997.[23][24]

Later, he was made the president of Microsoft's $19 billion Server and Tools Business and led a transformation of the company's business and technology culture from client services to cloud infrastructure and services.

Nadella leads a live discussion on Microsoft's cloud strategy in 2014 in San Francisco.
Nadella's tenure at Microsoft has emphasized working with companies and technologies with which Microsoft also competes, including Apple Inc.,[38] Salesforce,[39] IBM,[40] and Dropbox.[41] In contrast to previous Microsoft campaigns against the Linux operating system, Nadella proclaimed that "Microsoft ❤️ Linux",[42] and Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member in 2016.[43]

Under Nadella, Microsoft revised its mission statement to "empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more".[44] He orchestrated a cultural shift at Microsoft by emphasizing empathy, collaboration, and 'growth mindset'.[45][46] He has transformed Microsoft's corporate culture into one that emphasizes continual learning and growth.[47]

In 2014, Nadella's first acquisition with Microsoft was of Mojang, a Swedish game company best known for the computer game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion. He followed that by purchasing Xamarin for an undisclosed amount.[48] He oversaw the purchase of professional network LinkedIn[49] in 2016 for $26.2 billion.[50] On October 26, 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for US$7.5 billion.[51]

In 1992, Nadella married Anupama, the daughter of his father's IAS batchmate. She was his junior at Manipal pursuing a B.Arch in the Faculty of Architecture.[62] The couple had three children, a son and two daughters, and live in Clyde Hill[63] and Bellevue, Washington.[64] His son Zain was a legally blind quadriplegic with cerebral palsy.[65] Zain died in February 2022, at the age of 26.[66]
